What is Tiles Framework? How can we use it with Struts?


Tiles framework is an implementation of the Composite View pattern. In Tiles, we uses template as a layout of a page.
A template can be considered as a page structure with some gaps, called attributes, to be filled in your application. 
An attribute can be of three types:

string: it is a string to be directly rendered as it is. 
template: it is a template, with or without attributes. If it has attributes, you have to fill them too to render a page. 
Definition: A definition is a composition to be rendered to the end user; essentially a definition is composed of a template and completely or partially filled attributes.
 If all of its attributes are filled, it can be rendered to the end user.
 If not all of its attributes are filled, it is called an abstract definition, and it can be used as a base definition for extended definitions, or their missing attributes can be filled at runtime.
