Springbatch 

Has 3 sections 

1. ItemReader : read the item
2. ItemProcessor process the item
3. ItemWriter  wite the item
4. ThreadPoolTaskExecuter

Job repositories  responsible of the storing and updating of metadata information related to Job instance executions and Job contexts.
Spring stores as metadata information about their executions, the results obtained, their instances, the parameters used for the Jobs executed and the 
context where the processing runs.

1.Listener: Class JobExecutionListenerSupport provides after/before job has been executed with full report.
ThrottleLimit: maximum number  of concurrent tasklet executions allowed

Core pool size:  will  tells that pool executor will start with N number of threads
throttle-limit  limits the core pool size , no matter how many threads 

Type of Spring bacth processing :
1. Multithread steps- single process   same step runs, ItemReader,ItemWriter and process will be in paralel
	
2. Parallel Steps (single process) : different steps run in paralel. split steps using flow

3. Partitioning a Step (single or multi process): 
  Partition Steps and execute them remotely. The remote instances are Steps.
  
Repeat Templates: 
Implementation of the RepeatOperations It contains basic functionalities and default behavior for 
error handling and finalization mechanisms. Applications that do not want this default behavior should implement their custom Completion Policies.
