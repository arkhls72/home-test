EJB 
1. StateFull Session Bean: 	@Stateful
	It will maintain a conversational state with a client. The state is mainatianed for the duration of conversation between client and stateful session bean.
	When the client removes the session bean then Statefull session bean ends, and the state is destroyed.

2. Stateless Session bean: @Stateless
	It maintains states for the duration of Bean method invocation. after method has finished running successfully or unsunccessfully the state of all Its instance variables are dropped
	EJB containter is handleing create() and remove() methods of the bean.

3. Singleton Session Beans @Singlton

    Instantiated once per application and exists for the lifecycle of the application.
	Designed to be shared across and concurrently accessed by clients.

	Offers Similar functionality to stateless  beans  but there is only one singleton session bean per application
	Singleton  beans can implement web service endpoints.
	 It should be instantiated upon application startup to perform initialization tasks or perform cleanup tasks on application shutdown

	The Singleton is essentially  a Stateless bean with the pool size to be exactly 1,
	There is  one instance of the Singleton bean which can be invoked concurrently by multiple threads like a servlet. 
	It can do everything a Stateless can do such as support local and remote business interfaces, web services, security, transactions, and more. 
	Additionally, the Singleton can have its 

	@PostConstruct 
		method called with the application starts up and its 
	@PreDestroy 
		method called when the application shuts down. 
	
	This allows it to serve as an application lifecycle listener which is something only Servlets could do before. 
	It has an @Startup annotation which is similar in concept to the servlet ,
	but unlike servlets it doesn't take a number as an argument. 
	Instead, you can use an @DependsOn annotation to say which other Singletons you need and the container will ensure they start before you.


	 
3. Benefit of stateless session bean
	Bean pooling  : 
		EJB container pools the instance of steless beans, any instacne of stateless bean that is not currecntly invoked is available to be called by Container to service the client. 
		This gives a hight performance.
		
	Scalability 
		Typically to support the same number of clients, an application requires fewer stateless  beans than stateful benas. Stateless has less instances 
		
	Higher performance
		An EJB container will never move a stateless session bean from RAM out to a secondary storage which it may do with a stateful therefore  so 
		stateless session beans may offer greater performance than stateful

	
A stateless session bean can implement a web service, but a stateful session bean cannot.

When to use Stateful  
	
	The bean needs to hold information about the client during method invocations. - save data for specific user
	If the state of the bean represents the interaction between the bean and a specific client
	A stateful session bean cannot implement web services 
	

When to use Stateless 

	The bean’s state has no data for a specific client.
	The bean performs a generic task for all clients in a single method invocation,For example stateless session bean used to send an email that confirms an online order.
	If We want ti implemen t web services
	
	
When to use Singlton 

	State needs to be shared accross the application.
	A single enterprise bean needs to be accessed by multiple threads concurrently.
	The application needs  to perform tasks upon application startup and shutdown.

Strategies

	Stateless Session Façade Strategy
	
Consequences

	Introduces a layer that provides services to remote clients
	Exposes a uniform coarse-grained interface
	Reduces coupling between the tiers
	Promotes layering, increases flexibility and maintainability
	Reduces complexity
	Improves performance, reduces fine-grained remote methods
		Fine grained methods tend to be small and modular like setName()
		Coarse grained methods tend to be in accomplish several steps. like SaveOrder(), validate(),data entry,email and etc
	Centralizes security management
	Centralizes transaction control
	Exposes fewer remote interfaces to clients	


What is Transaction Propagation ?  @TransactionAttributeType
	It is  enum TransactionAttributeType that is  used with the @TransactionAttributeType 
	to specify whether the methods of a session bean or message driven bean are called with a valid transaction 	
	context.
			
        REQUIRED : (EJB 3 default)
	
		if bean 1() is called then T1 is created. if Bean1() called Bean2() the EBJ containter creates new T2 for the second call regardless T1 transaction is failed or commit.
		bean1() and bean2() won't share the transaction.
		If your method in a  bean needs to be completed without being affected by either commit or rollback from the calling session bean, REQUIRES_NEW is the way to go.
		Scenario:
        Login process with money transfere regardless if this transfer is successful or not (with a rollback), the logging facility would still need to be functional to log the status of 
		the transaction and it must not be affect by the rollback of the transfer. - 
	
	
	MANDATORY:
		Specifies that  the second methodB() will run its operation within the same transaction as methodA(). they both share the transction. usually the first one  methjodA() is acconated "required"  and 
		the MethodB() is MANDATORY
		
	NOT_SUPPORTED

	Are  non-transactional and will not participate in any existing transactions
	It won’t throw an error whether if it is within a transaction or not, but it just won’t participate in a transaction 

	if Method1() runs on T1 and calls Method2(NOT_SUPPORTED) then method2() will neither ride on T1 nor will it start its own transaction. It will simply suspend T1 or whatever transaction that the external
        
        invoker has, execute its individual contents, only then the transaction T1 will be resumed after that.

	SUPPORTS

	If calling method has no Transaction already open then SUPPORT method opens one otherwise Method2(SUPPORTS) will run in a same transaction as the  calling method. 
	TransactionAttributeType.SUPPORTS on methods that query objects which the underlying data is consistently updated (constantly changing) and would always be involved in other transaction methods that carries Transaction 
	Attribute Types like REQUIRED, MANDATORY or REQUIRES_NEW.
	
	 
	 NEVER 
	 Annotated with NEVER means never involved in any Transaction
	 I’ll annotate session bean methods with NEVER if they are only specifically involve in physical file reading and writing

EJB Web service

EJB 3.X  - By Wrapping  EJB in web Service interface  we can have EJB web services 

We annotate  Remote interface method by @WebMethod  to specify that this method is EJB web services web services. we are going to pass our paramater by @webparam

@Remote
@WebService(name = "CRMRetrieveService")
public interface CRMRetrieveWS extends Serializable{  
    @WebMethod
    StatusFormResponse status(@WebParam String enrolmentId);    
}

@Stateless
@Local
@WebService(name = "CRMRetrieveService")
public class CRMRetrieveWSBean implements CRMRetrieveWS {

    @WebMethod
    public @WebResult(name = "statusFormResponse")
	StatusFormResponse status(@WebParam(name = "enrolmentId") String enrolmentId) {

	}
1. we deploy EJB then get the wsdl file from aplication server console copy that in to CLient side and then with Maven we genertae request and response object of wsdl at run time



Difference between EJB 3 and EJB 2 

1. Annotations makes EJB 3.0 a latest technology while the EJB 2.0 has home and remote interfaces instead of annotations
2. EJB 3.0 has Java Persistence API  JPA but EJB 2  deploys entity beans for DB access.
3. EJB 3.0 uses POJOs along with metadata annotation, while EJB 2 uses  XMLDescriptor and JNDI deployed by EJB 2.0 for reference of objects. EJB 2.0 does not implement POJO.
4. EJB 2.0 is heavy when it comes to writing home and remote interfaces. EJB 3.0 has no restriction on using any of the standard interfaces. It is a well configured and simple POJO
   which doesn’t need to execute container callback methods such as ejbActive, ejbStore, etc which are used by EJB 2.0.

   
@Stateless
@DeclareRoles({"student" "librarian"})
public class LibraryBean implements LibraryRemote {
   @RolesAllowed({"librarian"})
   public void delete(Book book){
	  //delete book
   }
   
   @PermitAll
   public void viewBook(Book book){
      //view book
   }

   @DenyAll
   public void deleteAll(){
      //delete all books
   } 
}

Web Services and SOAP 
Is a software system that is desgined to support machine to machine synch intraction over the NET.

SOAP:   (Simple object access Control)
It is message simple XML based protocol to exchnage information over HTTP. SOAP messages are independent of any OS or application and transported by variety of protocols like HTTP,MIME, SMTP
	
JAXB
Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB)
The ability to marshal Java objects into XML and the inverse,  unmarshal XML back into Java objects.
In other 

JAXP
The Java API for XML Processing, or JAXP (pronounced jaks-p),  It provides the capability of validating and parsing XML documents.


XSLT: 
XML style sheet and Transformation :   To transofrm XML in to plain HTML  we are using XSLT 
	

JAX-RPC :
Allows a client Java application to invoke a Java-based Web Service with a known description

JAX-WS 2.0
The JAX-RPC name is misleading, developers assume that all JAX-RPC is about is just RPC, 
not Web Services. By renaming JAX-RPC to JAX-WS we can eliminate this confusion. 


WSDL 
-----
WSDL (Web Services Description Language)  is an XML-based language for describing Web services and how to access them.
contains a set of tags to describe request and response format

The document describes a Web service. 
It specifies the location of the service and the operations (or methods) that privides the services
  
 An XML-formatted language used to describe a Web service's capabilities as collections of communication 
endpoints capable of exchanging messages. WSDL is an integral part of UDDI, an XML-based worldwide business registry.
WSDL is the language that UDDI uses. WSDL was developed jointly by Microsoft and IBM. 
	

Web service Security : 

Encrption of WS messages.  The protocol to specify how integrity and confidentiality can be enforced on messages 	

In genreal they are Interceptors that Traps request to SOAP messages to be authenticated.
<bean id="wsSecurityInterceptor" class="org.springframework.ws.soap.security.xwss.XwsSecurityInterceptor">
        <property name="secureResponse" value="false"/>
        <property name="policyConfiguration"
                  value="classpath:securityPolicy.xml"/>
        <property name="callbackHandler">
            <bean class="org.springframework.ws.soap.security.xwss.callback.SpringPlainTextPasswordValidationCallbackHandler">
                <property name="authenticationManager" ref="securityService"/>
            </bean>
        </property>
    </bean>
 
Spring: IT is an interceptor --> XWSSecurityInterceptor  that has some properties ==> CallBackHandler
One of them is CallBackHandler that refrence the authenticationManager called SecurityService. This is the service that we implement to return Spring Authentication


public class SecurityService implements AuthenticationManager {
	private final Log log = LogFactory.getLog(this.getClass());
	@Autowired(required=true)
	WebkinzUserService webkinzUserService;
	@Override
	public Authentication authenticate(Authentication auth)
			throws AuthenticationException {
		log.info("Start Authentication : ");
		if (auth != null) {
        	String userName = auth.getName();
        	if("dummyWebkinzUser".equalsIgnoreCase(userName)) {
        		return auth;
        	}
        	String securityToken = auth.getCredentials().toString();
        	if (webkinzUserService.isWebkinzeStoreUserValid(userName, securityToken)){
        		log.info("END Authentication : " + userName + "validated");
        		return auth;
        	}else{
        		throw new BadCredentialsException("Username/password doesn't not exist");
        	}
        }

        return null;
}
}	
	

What is ACID in Transaction :  achrynom of Transaction properties 

	
Atomicity
---------
All changes to data are performed as if they are a single operation. That is, all the changes are performed, or none of them are.
For example, in an application that transfers funds from one account to another, the atomicity property ensures that, if a debit is made successfully from one account, the corresponding credit is made to the other account.

Consistency
Data is in a consistent state when a transaction starts and when it ends.
For example, in an application that transfers funds from one account to another, the consistency property ensures that the total value of funds in both the accounts is the same at the start and end of each transaction.

Isolation
-------------
The intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions. As a result, transactions that run concurrently appear to be serialized.
For example, in an application that transfers funds from one account to another, the isolation property ensures that another transaction sees the transferred funds in one account or the other, but not in both, nor in neither.

Durability		
-----------
